    <h1> Less Input, Improved Work Productivity For Tech Companies    </h1> 
       
    <p>
    “Getting a
      proportionate result for the effort you’ve put in is called
      productivity. But when it comes to the technological industry, that’s
      simply not good enough, thanks to the demand pressure on your business
      output and the existing competitive floor”, says Jeffrey Zhou, CEO and
      Founder of Fig Loans.
      <br />
      So, your output has to be greater than the effort you put in, a concept
      that means doing little to achieve more results. And that’s only
      possible by addressing some of the factors that strain your productivity
      in the first place. For example, repetitive tasks. In a report by
      SimplyFlows, employees waste 40% of their working time on repetitive
      tasks. A perfect example of this in a typical tech industry includes
      manually checking for code bugs, inputting data from spreadsheets into
      the system database, labeling and tagging data for machine learning, and
      so on. So, if we eliminate these tasks, productivity should shoot up,
      and revenue should follow suit. However, elimination of such tasks is
      only on the basis that they do not make up the bulk of your core
      operations—which we can bet does. Fortunately, AI-powered software
      programs save the day by helping you handle them all—talk about
      automatic migration of data from sheets to online databases in seconds,
      sleek and constant check for code bugs and errors, and handling routine
      customer queries through conversational chatbots. “For tech businesses
      that are already so busy with the ‘techie assignments’ on their desks,
      using AI as a virtual assistant provides a lot of relief. This allows
      your workers to focus on the more crucial tasks. As a result, there’s
      increased productivity despite doing much less than before,” Jonathan
      Feniak, General Counsel at LLC Attorney, says. However, this positive
      influence has an implication—if AI can do it, then why still hire
      humans?

    <h2>Potential Job Displacement: AI in, Humans Out </h2>
    <p>
      Sergey Taver, Marketing Manager at Precision Watches, a company
      specializing in pre-owned Rolex watches since 1946, says, “AI handling
      repetitive tasks means businesses can now save cost by simply cutting
      their workforce in half, or maybe more. Well, at least, that’s what’s
      happening right now. AI is gradually becoming the most sought-after
      ideal worker.” Just seven months into 2024, about 108,591 employees had
      already lost their jobs. In January, about 122 tech companies cut a
      total of 34,107 jobs, resulting in thousands of role displacements and a
      frenzy in search of newer job openings. This was followed by 15,589 tech
      layoffs in February by approximately 78 companies and a lesser figure of
      7,403 in March by 37 tech organizations. Mid-year months and the closer
      ones like April have since seen more than 21,473 job losses from about
      50 companies in 2024. As of the time of writing this article, there’s no
      data on job losses for June and July, but one thing is sure: they’ll
      number in the tens of thousands. While this is still a far cry from the
      263,180 layoffs in 2023, we might be getting closer as 2024 ends,
      probably by the time you read this article. Perhaps these cuts are not
      as a result of AI integration? Well, we assure you over 70% are.
      However, some tech companies take the silent approach instead of
      announcing AI as a reason for their layoffs. On the other end, some
      companies take a more open approach. For instance, Suumit Shah, the CEO
      of Dukaan, announced in 2023 that he had replaced 90% of his customer
      support employees with a chatbot named Lina. He enjoyed the euphoria for
      a moment before social fans and laid-off workers retorted with some
      hard-hitting comments. Of course, that didn’t really solve anything.
      Obviously, Suumit is not the only one who has laid off a massive chunk
      of his organizational team so far. Moreover, the layoffs are not likely
      to end anytime soon. About 44% of companies using or planning to use AI
      already project, cutting off 21% to 23% of their workforce. Worse still,
      Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, boldly proclaimed that AI would take over
      coding and everything related to programming in the years to come. “Over
      the last 10-15 years, almost everybody who sits on a stage like this
      would tell you that it is vital that your children learn computer
      science, everybody should learn how to program. In fact, it is almost
      exactly the opposite. It is our job to create computing technology such
      that nobody has to program, and that the programming language is human.
      Everybody in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of AI,”
      — Jensen Huang. The existence of No Code/Low Code platforms proves him
      right to some extent. But then, is this the death of the job market for
      human techies? Not really. We just have to do better than these bots
      while acknowledging their roles in helping us become better. We created
      them, after all.

    <h2>
      Shift From Routine Task-Oriented Jobs To More Creative And Strategic
      Roles
    </h2>
    <p>
      OpenAI’s Chief Technology Officer, Mira Murati, broke the shell with a
      glib comment and bluntly said, “Some creative jobs maybe will go away,
      but maybe they shouldn't have been there in the first place.” That’s
      ridiculously insensitive, coming at a time when layoffs were at an
      all-time high in the year. Sam Altman has not shied away from making
      similar comments in recent months as well, with much emphasis on how
      “jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop.” But they are still
      far off from Murati’s outright declaration against automatable roles.
      While we don’t entirely agree with her, either way, there’s an iota of
      reality in the point she made. Some basic jobs will really bear the
      burden of a disruptive influence. The UK's Institute for Public Policy
      Research backed this up with a report on an incoming job apocalypse for
      entry-level roles, administrative duties, and other part-time tasks.
      According to Kyran Schmidt, Cofounder at Outverse, “Customer support and
      other front desk jobs are not exempt from this change either. There are
      now dozens of super-effective customer support AI agents and chatbots
      that can effortlessly handle human queries and come up with smart,
      hyper-personalized responses in seconds, with little to no human
      assistance.” But as Murati said, this shift will force us to look out
      for more resourceful, creative, and strategic roles that AI can’t
      possibly handle at the moment. “Of course, this AI-human brawl is not
      ending anytime soon. AI will always improve to take on complex
      assignments, thus effectively eliminating human job autonomy. That
      sounds ridiculous, but it is true. You’re racing to the top with AI on
      your tail,” adds Bert Hofhuis, Founder of Every Investor.
